    "Football is the most popular sport in England. Almost everyone follows and supports a football club in England. There are about 40,000 football clubs registered with the Football Association(FA) which is the governing body for football in England. One of the sources of the clubs is matchday ticket sales. Fans would buy tickets to watch their favourite teams play in stadiums all over England and would travel to other regions to support the teams. "
